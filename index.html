            Hi!<br>
            I am Mast3r_waf1z, or Skademanden. I am a bachelor graduate / master student at Aalborg University. I graduated as a bachelor in Computer Engineering in 2023, and i am currently studying a master's degree in Software Engineering.<br><br>
            The purpose of this website is to show an insight in my competenses in a way that exceeds the capability of a CV or a resume. If my CV is more of interest to you, feel free to check it out at: XX, or compile it yourself.<br><br>
            I would describe myself as somewhat of a computer enthusiast, such that anything related to computers interest me to some capacity, (though some topic do bore me). As such i am a Linux user i also enjoy dabbling in exciting distributions like Arch Linux, Gentoo Linux, Linux From Scratch and its derivatives, and NixOS a lot.<br><br>
            This site is currently in its second iteration, if you're curious to the history, the last version of the original site is at this commit: XX, i descided in 2024 to rewrite the whole thing, my reasoning was that i wanted it to be more dynamic and to feel more alive. Both sites have something in common though: Its inspired by old static web 1.0 websites!<br><br>
            On this site you will also find dedicated threads to each of my interests, as i also enjoy Warhammer 40000, Gaming (active member of the Linux gaming community), Anime and manga, and of course music - I'm a huge metal fan!
