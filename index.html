            Welcome to Skademaskinen!

            Hi!... <p class="header_i">> </p><p class="header_link">whoami</p><br>
            I am Mast3r_waf1z, or Skademanden. I am a bachelor graduate / master student at Aalborg University. I graduated as a bachelor in Computer Engineering in 2023, and i am currently studying a master's degree in Software Engineering.<br><br>
            The purpose of this website is to show an insight in my competenses in a way that exceeds the capability of a CV or a resume. If my CV is more of interest to you, feel free to check it out at: XX, or compile it yourself.<br><br>
            I would describe myself as somewhat of a computer enthusiast, such that anything related to computers interest me to some capacity, (though some topics do bore me). As such i am a Linux user i also enjoy dabbling in exciting distributions like Arch Linux, Gentoo Linux, Linux From Scratch and its derivatives, and NixOS a lot.<br><br>
            This site is currently in its second iteration, if you're curious to the history, the last version of the original site is at <a href="https://github.com/Mast3rwaf1z/Mast3rwaf1z.github.io/tree/cc2086e4f01dc23d6918a3e13dade6d437e7079d">this commit</a>, If you want to run it yourself, run these commands in a Linux terminal:<br> 
                <code>git clone https://github.com/Mast3rwaf1z/Mast3rwaf1z.github.io.git /tmp/website</code><br> 
                <code>cd /tmp/website</code><br>
                <code>git checkout cc2086e</code><br>
                <code>firefox file:///tmp/website/index.html</code><br>
            I descided in 2024 to rewrite the whole thing, my reasoning was that i wanted it to be more dynamic and to feel more alive. Both sites have something in common though: Its inspired by old static web 1.0 websites!<br><br>
            
            On this site you will also find dedicated threads to each of my interests, as i also enjoy Warhammer 40000, Gaming (active member of the Linux gaming community), Anime and manga, and of course music - I'm a huge metal fan!<br><br>
